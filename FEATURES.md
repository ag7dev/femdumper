# Potential Enhancements

This document lists potential ways to improve **FemDumper** in terms of code quality, stability, and performance. These points serve as suggestions for future work.

## Code Quality

- **Refactor long functions**: Break up large methods in `femdumpergui.py` into smaller, selfâ€‘contained functions for clarity and maintainability.
- **Introduce type hints**: Add Python type hints throughout the codebase. This will help with readability and static analysis.
- **Linting and formatting**: Adopt tools like `flake8` or `black` to enforce a consistent code style across the project.
- **Unit tests**: Create a test suite using `pytest` to validate critical functionality such as the scanners and settings management.

## Stability

- **Robust error handling**: Review all file and network operations to ensure exceptions are properly caught and logged. Provide informative user feedback when something goes wrong.
- **Configuration validation**: Validate settings loaded from `settings.json` to avoid unexpected crashes due to malformed data.
- **Dependency pinning**: Specify exact package versions in `requirements.txt` to ensure consistent behavior across environments.

## Performance

- **Concurrency improvements**: The scanners already use threads, but they could benefit from using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` more systematically or even `asyncio` to overlap I/O tasks.
- **Reduce redundant filesystem walks**: Combine scans that iterate over the same directory tree to minimize repeated disk I/O.
- **Lazy loading UI components**: Some heavy widgets could be created on demand instead of during startup to improve launch time.

Implementing these enhancements should lead to a cleaner codebase, better stability, and faster execution.
